# FinanceController

This project is a financial control system System and was made using Java 11 and Spring Boot. I used Spring Boot Data JPA and H2 Memory Database to manage data and create queries.
It's possible to input bills(a request in JSON format with value, date and type of bill), delete bills, see the sum of all or by type and see a list of them.

The project runs in memory and is configured to run on port 8080.

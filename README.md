# financial control system

This project is a full stack project of a financial control system System and was made using Java 11, Typescript, Spring Boot and Angular. I used Spring Data JPA and H2 Memory Database to manage data and create queries and Spring Batch to import data from a csv file to h2 database. I used JFreeChart to create a bar graph of the value by type.

The template was adapted from https://startbootstrap.com/previews/small-business

It's possible to manage the bills using a csv file, see a list of all bills, the amount spent on a type and the total and a graph of the amount spent by type.

The backend project runs in memory and is configured to run on port 8080.

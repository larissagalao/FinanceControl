# financial control system

This project is a financial control system System and was made using Java 11 and Spring Boot. I used Spring Boot Data JPA and H2 Memory Database to manage data and create queries. I used JFreeChart to create a bar graph of the value by type.

It's possible to input bills (a request in JSON format with value, date and type of bill), delete bills, see a list of all bills, a list by bill type, a list of types, the amount spent on a type, the total amount spent and a graph of the amount spent by type.

The project runs in memory and is configured to run on port 8080.

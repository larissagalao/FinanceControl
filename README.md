# financial control system

This project is a financial control system System and was made using Java 11 and Spring Boot. I used Spring Data JPA and H2 Memory Database to manage data and create queries and Spring Batch to import data from a csv file to h2 database. I used JFreeChart to create a bar graph of the value by type.

It's possible to input and delete bills using a csv file, see a list of all bills, a list by bill type, a list of types, the amount spent on a type, the total amount spent and a graph of the amount spent by type.

The project runs in memory and is configured to run on port 8080.
